    <b style="font-size:24px">Why the work Hyper Text & Markup Language</b>
    <p>The word hyper text markup language comprises the words <b>"hypertext"</b> and <b>"markup language"</b>. The term <b>"hypertext"</b> refers to the linking of the text with other documents and <b>"markup language"</b> refers to the language that uses the set of tags.<br>So, <b>HTML</b> is the linking of text with other documents using some sets of tags.</p>
    <p><b style="font-size: 15px; color: brown;">NOTE:</b> <b>Tags are just some text enclosed in angle braces &#60...&#62 For eg. &#60head&#62. Each tag has a different meaning and importance in building an HTML page.</b></p>
    <h3>A beautiful analogy to understand HTML:</h3>
    <figure>
        <img src="images/Analogy.png" alt="html analogy" style="max-width:65%;height:auto;">
    </figure>
    <p>Here in the explanation of the above analogy, the car skeleton refers to HTML with the page body. When that skeleton is painted it the car gates CSS and after all that car is provided with some functionalaities like engine, etc.(which refers to JavaScript), the car gets life and run. Similarly, when we develop our websites we need HTML for the structure and if we want our website to look goog and prettier we need CSS and if we want to add functionailities to our webpage we need JavaScript.</p>
