## 🧩 About This Repository

`MyCodingJournal` is a **daily code journal and learning vault** designed to track my personal growth in software development. This isn't just about solving problems — it's about building habits, reflecting on progress, and documenting everything that gets me closer to becoming a well-rounded developer.

Whether I'm diving into algorithms, building passion projects, taking notes from courses, or exploring ML and Web Dev — it's all here.
